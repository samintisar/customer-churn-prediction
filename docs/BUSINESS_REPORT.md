# Customer Churn Prediction: Business Report

**Project**: Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy  
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Author**: Churn Analytics Team

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of customer churn patterns and a predictive modeling solution for Telco, a telecommunications company experiencing a 26.54% annual churn rate. Our analysis of 7,043 customers revealed critical risk factors including contract type, customer tenure, and service configuration. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a Logistic Regression model achieving 84.6% ROC-AUC with 75.18% precision in identifying the top 10% highest-risk customers.

The financial impact is substantial: with $1.67 million in annual revenue currently at risk from churning customers, even a modest 10% reduction in churn through targeted retention efforts could save approximately $167,000 annually. Our model identifies month-to-month contract holders and customers in their first year as the highest-risk segments, with churn rates of 42.7% and 47.7% respectively—dramatically higher than long-term contract holders (2.8%) and loyal customers (9.5%).

The recommended three-phase implementation strategy focuses on deploying the predictive model to production, integrating automated risk scoring into existing CRM systems, and launching targeted retention campaigns for high-risk customer segments. With precise identification of at-risk customers and actionable insights into churn drivers, this solution enables proactive, cost-effective retention strategies that will significantly improve customer lifetime value and reduce acquisition costs.

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 Top Churn Drivers

Based on feature importance analysis and SHAP values, the strongest predictors of customer churn are:

1. **Contract Type** (Month-to-month vs. Long-term)
   - Month-to-month contracts: 42.7% churn rate
   - Two-year contracts: 2.8% churn rate
   - **Impact**: 15x higher risk for month-to-month customers
   - **Recommendation**: Incentivize contract upgrades with discounts or added services

2. **Customer Tenure** (Time with company)
   - Customers <1 year: 47.7% churn rate
   - Customers >4 years: 9.5% churn rate
   - **Impact**: New customers are 5x more likely to churn
   - **Recommendation**: Enhanced onboarding and first-year engagement programs

3. **Monthly Charges** (Price sensitivity)
   - Higher monthly charges correlate strongly with increased churn
   - Customers paying >$70/month show significantly elevated risk
   - **Impact**: Price-sensitive segment requires value demonstration
   - **Recommendation**: Value-based pricing and bundled service offerings

4. **Payment Method** (Electronic check users)
   - Electronic check users show higher churn rates
   - Automatic payment methods (credit card, bank transfer) associated with lower churn
   - **Impact**: Payment friction increases churn likelihood
   - **Recommendation**: Promote automatic payment enrollment with incentives

5. **Internet Service Type** (Fiber optic customers)
   - Fiber optic customers churn more frequently than DSL users
   - Likely indicates competitive market pressures
   - **Impact**: Premium service customers are vulnerable to competition
   - **Recommendation**: Enhanced support and loyalty programs for fiber customers

6. **Service Adoption** (Number of services used)
   - Customers with fewer add-on services (security, backup, tech support) churn more
   - Each additional service reduces churn probability
   - **Impact**: Low service engagement predicts churn
   - **Recommendation**: Cross-selling and service adoption campaigns

7. **Paperless Billing**
   - Customers without paperless billing show different engagement patterns
   - May indicate digital engagement preferences
   - **Impact**: Moderate predictor requiring combination with other factors

### 3.2 High-Risk Customer Segments

Based on multivariate analysis, three critical customer segments require immediate attention:

**Segment 1: New Month-to-Month Customers**
- **Characteristics**: Tenure <12 months, month-to-month contract
- **Size**: ~880 customers (12.5% of base)
- **Churn rate**: ~55-60% (estimated)
- **Annual revenue at risk**: ~$660,000
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - Combine two strongest risk factors

**Segment 2: High-Bill Fiber Optic Users**
- **Characteristics**: Fiber internet, monthly charges >$80, month-to-month
- **Size**: ~450 customers (6.4% of base)
- **Churn rate**: ~50% (estimated)
- **Annual revenue at Risk**: ~$480,000
- **Priority**: HIGH - Premium customers vulnerable to competition

**Segment 3: Single-Service Customers**
- **Characteristics**: Only phone or internet service, no add-ons
- **Size**: ~1,200 customers (17% of base)
- **Churn rate**: ~40% (estimated)
- **Annual revenue at risk**: ~$370,000
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Opportunity for service expansion and engagement

### 3.3 Revenue Impact Analysis

**Current State:**
- **Total customers**: 7,043
- **Churned customers (annual)**: 1,869 (26.54%)
- **Average monthly revenue per customer**: $64.76
- **Monthly revenue at risk**: $139,130.85
- **Annual revenue at risk**: $1,669,570.20

**Projected Impact of Retention Initiatives:**

Assuming targeted retention campaigns achieve industry-standard results:

| Churn Reduction | Customers Retained | Annual Revenue Saved | ROI Multiplier |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 5% | 93 customers | $72,000 | 3-5x |
| 10% | 187 customers | $145,000 | 4-6x |
| 15% | 280 customers | $217,000 | 5-7x |
| 20% | 374 customers | $290,000 | 6-8x |

**Note**: Industry data shows retention campaigns typically cost $500-$1,500 per customer retained, versus $2,000-$5,000 to acquire new customers, making retention investments highly cost-effective.

### 4.3 Business Interpretation

**What These Metrics Mean for Your Business:**

**ROC-AUC of 0.846 (Excellent)**
- The model successfully ranks customers by churn risk 84.6% better than random guessing
- For any randomly selected churner and non-churner, the model correctly ranks the churner as higher risk 84.6% of the time
- **Business Value**: Highly reliable for prioritizing retention efforts

**Top-Decile Precision of 75.18% (Outstanding)**
- Of the top 10% riskiest customers identified (approximately 704 customers), 75% will actually churn
- This is the most critical metric for targeted retention campaigns
- **Business Value**: Focus resources on ~530 customers with high confidence
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoids wasting retention budget on low-risk customers

**Recall of 80.48% (Very Good)**
- The model identifies 80% of all customers who will actually churn
- Only 20% of churners go undetected
- **Business Value**: Minimal loss of preventable churn
- **Trade-off**: Some false positives are acceptable to catch most real churners

**Precision of 51.37% (Adequate for Business Use)**
- About half of customers predicted to churn will actually churn
- While this may seem low, it's strong given the class imbalance (26.54% churn rate)
- **Business Value**: When combined with top-decile targeting, efficiency is dramatically improved
- **Context**: Much better than the 26.54% baseline churn rate

**Practical Application:**

Using a risk-based approach:
- **High Risk (Top 10%, Churn Probability ≥70%)**: 75% will churn → Aggressive retention (personal outreach, significant discounts)
- **Medium Risk (Next 20%, Churn Probability 40-70%)**: ~50% will churn → Moderate retention (automated campaigns, surveys)  
- **Low Risk (Bottom 70%, Churn Probability <40%)**: <25% will churn → Standard engagement (newsletters, loyalty programs)

This tiered strategy maximizes ROI by matching intervention cost to customer risk level.

### C. Assumptions and Limitations

**Assumptions:**
1. **Historical patterns hold**: Past churn behavior predicts future churn
2. **Feature stability**: Key predictive features remain relevant over time
3. **Class balance**: 26.54% churn rate remains relatively stable
4. **Data quality**: Customer records are accurate and complete
5. **Independent observations**: Customer decisions are independent of each other
6. **Intervention effectiveness**: Retention campaigns achieve industry-standard success rates

**Limitations:**
1. **External factors**: Model doesn't account for:
   - Competitor actions or market disruptions
   - Economic conditions affecting customer spending
   - Regulatory changes in telecommunications industry
   
2. **Temporal dynamics**:
   - Model trained on snapshot data (not time-series)

3. **Data constraints**:
   - Limited to structured data (no call center transcripts, social media, etc.)
   - No direct competitor pricing or offer data
   - Missing potentially valuable features (e.g., customer service interactions)

4. **Model drift**:
   - Accuracy may degrade over 6-12 months without retraining
   - Requires continuous monitoring and periodic updates
   - New customer segments may behave differently

5. **Intervention paradox**:
   - Successful retention changes future data distribution
   - Model must be retrained on post-intervention data
   - A/B testing needed to measure true impact

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Monthly model performance monitoring dashboard
- Quarterly retraining with new data
- A/B test all retention campaigns to measure causality
- Continuous feature engineering to incorporate new data sources
- Ensemble approach with periodic algorithm comparison
