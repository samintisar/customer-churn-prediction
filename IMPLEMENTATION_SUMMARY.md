## How to Use

### Option 1: Run the Python Script (Recommended for automated execution)

```bash
# From project root
python scripts/run_model_experiments.py
```

This will:
1. Load all preprocessed data
2. Train both models (baseline & advanced)
3. Evaluate and compare performance
4. Generate all visualizations
5. Save all models
6. Print comprehensive summary

**Estimated runtime**: 5-10 minutes (depending on GridSearchCV)

### Option 2: Use Jupyter Notebook (Recommended for interactive exploration)

```bash
# Navigate to notebooks
cd notebooks

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open 02_model_experiments.ipynb
# Run all cells sequentially
```

The notebook cells contain the same code as the script, broken into logical sections for step-by-step execution.
