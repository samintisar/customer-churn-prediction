## 🧠 Model Performance

### Selected Model: Logistic Regression ✅
After comprehensive evaluation, **Logistic Regression** was selected as the production model due to:
- **Superior ROC-AUC** (0.846 vs 0.840 for Random Forest)
- **High Interpretability** - Clear coefficient weights for stakeholders
- **Fast Scoring** - Real-time prediction capability
- **Reliability** - Stable performance across validation sets

### Performance Metrics (Test Set - 1,409 Customers)

| Metric | Score | Business Interpretation |
|--------|-------|------------------------|
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.846** | Excellent ability to distinguish churners from non-churners |
| **Precision** | **0.514** | 51% of predicted churners actually churn |
| **Recall** | **0.805** | Identifies 80% of actual churners |
| **F1 Score** | **0.627** | Balanced performance measure |
| **Top-Decile Precision** | **0.752** | **75% accuracy on highest-risk 10%** ⭐ |

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
- **True Negatives**: 750 (correctly identified non-churners)
- **False Positives**: 285 (predicted to churn but didn't - acceptable for proactive campaigns)
- **False Negatives**: 73 (missed churners - only 20% of actual churners)
- **True Positives**: 301 (correctly identified churners)

### Model Comparison

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | Winner |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| ROC-AUC | **0.846** | 0.840 | ✓ Logistic |
| Precision | 0.514 | **0.548** | Random Forest |
| Recall | **0.805** | 0.727 | ✓ Logistic |
| F1 Score | **0.627** | 0.625 | ✓ Logistic |
