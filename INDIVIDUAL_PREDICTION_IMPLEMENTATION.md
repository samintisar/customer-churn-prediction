# Individual Prediction Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive `render_individual_prediction_page()` function in `app/dashboard.py` for real-time customer churn prediction with interactive features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Interactive Input Form

- Emoji icons for better UX

### 2. ✅ Predict Button
- Prominent primary button that triggers prediction
- Calculates total charges automatically (tenure × monthly charges)
- Applies feature engineering pipeline via loaded `FeatureEngineer`
- Generates prediction from loaded model
- Stores results in session state for what-if analysis

### 3. ✅ Results Display
Features four key metrics in a professional layout:

**Churn Probability**
- Large metric with color-coding:
  - 🔴 Red if >70% (HIGH risk)
  - 🟠 Orange if 40-70% (MEDIUM risk)
  - 🟢 Green if <40% (LOW risk)
- Shows delta from 50% baseline

**Risk Tier Badge**
- Visual classification: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- Color-coded emoji indicators

**Estimated Retention Value**
- Calculates 12-month retention value using `calculate_retention_value()`
- Shows potential revenue saved

**3-Year Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
- Simple calculation: monthly charges × 36 months
- Gives perspective on customer value

### 4. ✅ Recommended Action Section
Displays comprehensive retention strategy:

- **Priority-based Alert Box**:
  - HIGH risk: Red error box with urgent message
  - MEDIUM risk: Yellow warning box with proactive message
  - LOW risk: Green success box with standard care message

- **Action Recommendation**:
  - Detailed retention action from `recommend_action()` function
  - Personalized based on risk tier and customer profile

- **Action Metrics**:
  - Priority Level (1=Urgent, 2=Important, 3=Standard)
  - Contact Channel (Phone/Email/Newsletter)
  - Discount Offer percentage
  - Estimated Cost of intervention

- **ROI Calculation**:
  - Shows expected return on investment
  - Formula: (Retention Value - Cost) / Cost × 100

### 5. ✅ Explanation Section

**SHAP Waterfall Plot**
- Visual explanation showing how each feature contributes to prediction
- Shows base value and how features push prediction higher/lower
- Automatically handles both TreeExplainer and general Explainer
- Graceful fallback if SHAP generation fails

**Feature Impact Summary**
Two key lists displayed side-by-side:

- **Top 5 Factors Increasing Risk** (🔺):
  - Features with positive SHAP values
  - Shows SHAP contribution and feature value
  - Sorted by impact magnitude

- **Top 5 Factors Decreasing Risk** (🔻):
  - Features with negative SHAP values
  - Shows protective factors keeping customer
  - Helps identify strengths to leverage

### 6. ✅ What-If Analysis

Three interactive scenario tabs:

#### **Tab 1: Contract Upgrade Analysis**
- Tests all contract types (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
- Shows new probability, change, and risk reduction
- Displays results in clean dataframe
- Recommends best contract option

#### **Tab 2: Service Changes Analysis**
- Tests adding services:
  - Online Security
  - Tech Support
  - Online Backup
  - Streaming TV
  - Streaming Movies
- Only tests services customer doesn't have
- Categorizes impact: ✅ Reduces Risk / ⚠️ Minor Impact / ❌ Increases Risk
- Recommends top service to add

#### **Tab 3: Payment Method Analysis**
- Tests all 4 payment methods
- Shows probability change for each
- Recommends: ✅ Switch / ➡️ Consider / ❌ No Change
- Identifies best payment method to reduce risk

#### **Combined Intervention Simulator**
- Allows testing multiple changes simultaneously
- Interactive controls for:
  - Contract type
  - Online Security
  - Tech Support
  - Payment Method
  - Online Backup
- Shows before/after comparison with metrics
- Provides actionable feedback on combined impact

### 7. ✅ User Experience Enhancements

**For Customer Service Representatives**:
- Clean, intuitive layout with emoji icons
- Clear section headers and descriptions
- Helpful tooltips on metrics
- Color-coded risk indicators
- Professional metric cards
- Expandable error details for troubleshooting

**Error Handling**:
- Checks for feature engineer availability
- Graceful fallback if SHAP fails
- Detailed error messages with traceback
- User-friendly warnings and suggestions

**Session State Management**:
- Stores prediction results for what-if analysis
- Maintains original inputs for comparison
- Enables seamless scenario testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- `streamlit` - Dashboard framework
- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `numpy` - Numerical operations
- `shap` - Model explainability
- `matplotlib` - SHAP plot visualization
- Custom modules:
  - `src.retention_strategy` - Risk classification and recommendations
  - `src.feature_engineering` - Feature transformation
  - `src.models` - Model loading

### Key Functions Used
1. `load_feature_engineer()` - Loads fitted FeatureEngineer
2. `classify_risk_tier(prob)` - Classifies risk level
3. `recommend_action(tier, profile)` - Generates retention action
4. `calculate_retention_value(profile)` - Estimates retention value
5. SHAP library functions for explainability

### Data Flow
1. User inputs → Form submission
2. Create DataFrame with customer attributes
3. Apply feature engineering transformation
4. Model prediction (probability)
5. Risk classification
6. Generate recommendations
7. Calculate SHAP values
8. Display results and explanations
9. Enable what-if scenario testing

## Usage

To run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

Navigate to the "🔍 Individual Prediction" tab to access the new functionality.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Enter customer details and click predict
   - Verify all metrics display correctly
   - Check color-coding matches risk level

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with tenure = 0 (new customer)
   - Test with tenure = 72 (long-term customer)
   - Test with very high/low monthly charges
   - Test all contract types

3. **What-If Analysis**:
   - Verify contract changes update probability
   - Test service additions
   - Test payment method changes
   - Test combined interventions

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure graceful failure if feature engineer missing
   - Check SHAP fallback behavior
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add customer ID lookup to pre-fill form
2. Export prediction report as PDF
3. Historical prediction tracking
4. A/B testing simulator
5. Sensitivity analysis for each feature
6. Batch prediction upload
7. Integration with CRM systems

## Notes

- All required features from the specification are implemented
- Code follows existing dashboard patterns and style
- User-friendly for customer service representatives
- Comprehensive error handling
- Professional UI with color-coding and metrics
- Interactive what-if analysis enables exploration
- SHAP explanations provide transparency

The implementation is production-ready and fully integrated with the existing dashboard architecture.
