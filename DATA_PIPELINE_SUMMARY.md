### 2. `src/feature_engineering.py`

**Implemented as `FeatureEngineer` Class** (scikit-learn compatible):

**Tenure Features**:
- `tenure_group` - Categorical bins (0-1yr, 1-2yr, 2-4yr, 4yr+)
- `is_new_customer` - Binary flag for < 6 months
- `tenure_years` - Continuous normalized tenure

**Spending Features**:
- `avg_monthly_spend` - TotalCharges / tenure (handles division by zero)
- `charge_increase` - Binary flag if MonthlyCharges > historical average
- `total_charges_per_month` - Alternative spending metric

**Service Features**:
- `total_services` - Count of active services (0-8)
- `has_multiple_services` - Binary flag for > 1 service
- `has_premium_services` - Binary flag for security + backup
- `has_internet` - Binary flag for any internet service
- `has_fiber` - Binary flag for fiber optic

**Contract Features**:
- `contract_stability` - Ordinal encoding (0=month-to-month, 1=1yr, 2=2yr)
- `is_electronic_payment` - Binary flag for electronic payment methods
- `paperless_binary` - Binary flag for paperless billing

**Pipeline Steps**:
1. Create engineered features
2. One-hot encode categorical variables (drop_first=True)
3. Standardize all numerical features (StandardScaler)

**Methods**:
- `fit_transform(X, y)` - Fit on training data
- `transform(X)` - Transform new data (test/val)
- `save(filepath)` - Persist fitted transformer
- `load(filepath)` - Load fitted transformer

**Features**:
- ✅ Fully reproducible (saves scaler and feature names)
- ✅ Handles train/test consistency (adds missing columns, removes extras)
- ✅ No data leakage (fit only on training data)
- ✅ Logging for all operations
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script: `scripts/test_pipeline.py`

Runs comprehensive 8-step validation:
1. ✅ Load raw data
2. ✅ Validate data quality
3. ✅ Clean data
4. ✅ Save cleaned data
5. ✅ Split into train/val/test
6. ✅ Engineer features
7. ✅ Save artifacts
8. ✅ Final validation (no NaNs, consistent features, no lost samples)

**Test Results**: All tests passed ✓

---

## 🔍 Data Quality Checks

### Issues Found and Resolved:
1. **TotalCharges as string** → Converted to numeric, filled 11 missing values
2. **SeniorCitizen as int** → Converted to categorical (Yes/No) for consistency
3. **Whitespace in categorical values** → Stripped and standardized

### Final Data Quality:
- ✅ Zero missing values
- ✅ Zero duplicate rows
- ✅ Consistent data types
- ✅ No infinite values
- ✅ Properly scaled numerical features

## 🎯 Key Features of Implementation

### Design Principles:
1. **Modular** - Separate concerns (loading, cleaning, engineering)
2. **Reproducible** - Fixed random seeds, saved transformers
3. **Production-Ready** - Error handling, logging, validation
4. **Documented** - Comprehensive docstrings
5. **Tested** - Built-in test functions
6. **Windows-Compatible** - No Unicode characters in output

### Best Practices:
- ✅ Stratified splitting preserves class distribution
- ✅ Feature engineering fit only on training data (no leakage)
- ✅ Scaler fit only on training data (no leakage)
- ✅ Consistent feature names across splits
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Type hints for better IDE support

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Features from user request not in dataset**:
   - `support_tickets` - Not present in Telco dataset
   - `logins_30d` - Not present in Telco dataset
   - `recency_days` - Not present in Telco dataset
   
   **Solution**: Created proxy features from available data (service counts, contract stability, etc.)

2. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Churn rate: 26.54% (moderate imbalance)
   - **Mitigation**: Models will use `class_weight='balanced'`

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Loading and Processing New Data:
```python
from src.data_loader import load_raw_data, clean_data
from src.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer

# Load data
df = load_raw_data('data/raw/new_data.csv')
df_clean = clean_data(df)

# Engineer features
fe = FeatureEngineer.load('models/feature_engineer.pkl')
X_processed = fe.transform(df_clean.drop(columns=['Churn']))
```

### Training Workflow:
```python
from src.data_loader import load_raw_data, clean_data, split_data
from src.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer

# Load and split
df = load_raw_data('data/raw/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')
df_clean = clean_data(df)
X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = split_data(df_clean)

# Engineer features
fe = FeatureEngineer()
X_train_proc = fe.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_val_proc = fe.transform(X_val)
X_test_proc = fe.transform(X_test)

# Save for later
fe.save('models/feature_engineer.pkl')
```
